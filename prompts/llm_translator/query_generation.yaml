user: |
  Given a natural language question, generate a Cypher query to find relevant information in a Neo4j graph.

  ## Graph Schema

  Nodes have label `:Node` with these properties:
  - `id`: UUID string
  - `type`: "Observation", "Claim", "Resolution", "Entity", or "ExtractedTriple"
  - `source`: who created this node
  - `timestamp`: ISO8601 datetime string
  - `raw_content`: original text (on Observations)
  - `name`: entity name (on Entity nodes)
  - `confidence`: float 0-1 (on Claims)
  - `subject_text`, `predicate_text`, `object_text`: relationship components

  Relationships:
  - `SUBJECT`: from Claim/Observation to Entity
  - `BASIS`: from Claim to what it's based on
  - `SUPERSEDES`: from newer Claim to older one it replaces
  - `CONTRADICTS`: between conflicting Claims
  - `HAS_EXTRACTION`: from Observation to ExtractedTriple

  ## Output Format

  Return ONLY a valid Cypher query string.
  No explanation, no markdown, no code fences.
